# LeetCode Problem Solving in JavaScript 🧩

Welcome to my LeetCode problem-solving repository! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, written in JavaScript. I aim to solve problems from different categories such as algorithms, data structures, and system design, and continuously improve my coding and problem-solving skills.

## 🏆 Goals
- Sharpen algorithmic thinking.
- Strengthen JavaScript skills.
- Prepare for coding interviews.
- Learn new data structures and techniques.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each problem is stored in a folder named after the corresponding LeetCode problem. Inside each folder, you will find:
- **Solution in JavaScript**: The code for the problem solution.
